                      Hello nice to meet you, my name is David I'm 21 years old and I'm in 4th year of CS engineering school at <strong><a href="https://www.utt.fr">l'Universit√© de Technologie de Troyes</a></strong>. I like many things, like sports, photography, music, cooking but most importantly programming.
                      
                        I am seeking for a six-month internship starting from February 2023. I wish to deepen my knowledge in web development, both as front-end and back-end. <br/>I already know how to code in php and javascript, however I still have a superficial knowledge of frameworks built on these languages.
                      
                      A 6 months internship would be for me the opportunity to learn how to work in a team, master one or more frameworks like ReactJS, AngularJS or Laravel and especially gain experience and maturity in this domain. I am eager to learn web development.
                      <br/>
                      <br/>
                      if you are looking for a intern in web development, feel free to contact me on Linkedin or at my email address.
                    </p>
